        <h1>Short and Sweet</h1>
        <p>Soulayma Boutique hit the scene in September of 2014 to revolutionize the ‘Hijab’ industry in Canada and North America as a whole. Thanks to our loyal clientele, today, Soulayma Boutique is currently the <strong>#1 Online Hijab Brand</strong> founded in Canada and one of the World’s Leading Online Hijab Stores.</p>

        <h1>The Story: How it All Started</h1>
        <p>As many of you already know, we grew up purchasing hijabs from other countries, waiting for Eid or other Islamic events so we can get our hands on some nice hijabs or shopping at local western stores to find nice shawls we can turn into hijabs! It really doesn’t need to be that way!</p>
        <p>In April 2014, while on maternity leave, thirty days after giving birth, the founder of Soulayma Boutique attempted to purchase some new ‘fresh’ hijabs online while at home. Long story short after surfing the web for local online hijab stores and making a purchase, she received the hijabs only to find they weren’t the perfect hijabs in terms of transparency, quality, size etc. It just wasn’t what she was looking for.</p>
        <p>She quickly realized she wasn’t the only one having this problem and decided it was time for a much-needed change. She made a promise to herself that she would try her best, and would not stop until she delivers what other Muslimahs are searching for and to make sure everyone ended up happy after buying their hijab online – from Soulayma Boutique of course!</p>
