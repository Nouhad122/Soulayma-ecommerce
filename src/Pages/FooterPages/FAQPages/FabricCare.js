    <h6>a. How should I wash/dry/iron my product?</h6>
    <p>
      You should hand wash and air dry our products for best results. If you would like to machine wash, wash on warm, delicate using a gentle detergent and tumble dry for best results. Be sure to wash with other scarves/hijabs and very similar colours ONLY!
    </p>

    <h6>b. I got a stain on my product. How do I remove it?</h6>
    <p>
      Wash it using the instructions provided in the previous question. If it does not come out, then use a stain remover carefully following the instructions on the product label. Unfortunately, the toughest stains may not come out. Treat our products with care. Prevention is better than cure!
    </p>

    <h6>c. I got a stain on my product. Can you replace it?</h6>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, since it was a stain you caused by the way you used the product, we cannot replace it.
