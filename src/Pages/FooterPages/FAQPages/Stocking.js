    <h6>a. When will you restock <em>a specific hijab wrap/specific product</em>?</h6>
    <p>
      We cannot give an exact date, but we send out an e-mail to all our subscribers when we have major restocks.
    </p>
    <p>Please check our website at that time.</p>

    <h6>b. Can you stock/restock <em>a specific pattern, colour, size, shape, fabric</em>?</h6>
    <p>
      Send in your suggestion. We take all suggestions into consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your suggestion is a totally new design, it might take time to introduce it into a new collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your suggestion was part of an older collection or one weâ€™ve carried before, you may see it on the website the next time we restock.
    </p>

    <h6>c. Can you notify me when you <em>a specific hijab wrap/specific product</em>?</h6>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, as of now, we cannot send personal e-mails to notify you once items are restocked. We are looking into adding a wish list which will send automated notifications for the product you have your eye on.
    </p>
    <p>If you are on our e-mail list, we will send an e-mail updating you.</p>
